# Bridging the Gap Between AI Planning and Reinforcement Learning (PRL @ ICAPS) – [Workshop at ICAPS 2022 (June 13-17)](http://icaps22.icaps-conference.org/)

### This site presents the most up-to-date information about the PRL @ ICAPS workshop. Please, visit [ICAPS 2022](http://icaps22.icaps-conference.org) for information about the general conference.

NEWS: This year the PRL workshop will have two editions:
The first one at ICAPS 2022, and the second one at IJCAI 2022.
PRL@ICAPS  authors  will be given the opportunity  to  specify
whether  they  want  their  submission to  be  considered  for
PRL@IJCAI as well.  The final decision will be made separately
for each of the workshop locations.
Please see the website for additional information on the two
editions.

While  AI  Planning and  Reinforcement  Learning  communities focus  on  similar
sequential decision-making  problems, these communities remain  somewhat unaware
of each other  on specific problems, techniques,  methodologies, and evaluation.

This  workshop  aims  to  encourage discussion  and  collaboration  between  the
researchers in the  fields of AI planning and reinforcement  learning. We aim to
bridge  the  gap between  the  two  communities,  facilitate the  discussion  of
differences and similarities in existing techniques, and encourage collaboration
across the  fields. We  solicit interest  from AI researchers  that work  in the
intersection of planning  and reinforcement learning, in  particular, those that
focus on intelligent decision making. As  such, the joint workshop program is an
excellent  opportunity  to  gather  a  large and  diverse  group  of  interested
researchers.

## Workshop topics

The  workshop solicits work at the intersection of  the fields of  reinforcement
learning  and  planning.  One example  is so-called  goal-directed reinforcement
learning,  where a  goal must be  achieved,  and no partial credit  is given for

getting  closer to the goal.  In this c
Veronique Ventosase,  a usual metric is  success rate. We
also solicit work solely in one area that can influence advances in the other so
long as the connections are *clearly articulated* in the submission.

Submissions are invited for topics on, but not limited to:

* Theoretical aspects of planning and reinforcement learning
* Goal-oriented sequential decision methods combining planning, RL
 or other ML methods.
* Goal-directed reinforcement learning (model-based, Bayesian, deep, etc.)
* Safe Reinforcement Learning and Planning
* Certification/analysis of learned policies/models
* Planning using approximated/uncertain (learned) models
* Monte Carlo Planning
* Learning search heuristics for planner guidance
* Model representation and learning for planning
* Applications of both reinforcement learning and planning
* Various levels of generalization (across goals, objects/domain, domains)
* Reinforcement Learning and planning competition(s)

## Invited Speakers

* [Veronique Ventos](https://nukk.ai/)) - *Nook: a new generation AI dedicated to the game of Bridge*
	- Abstract: On March 25 2022, at the end of a two-day Bridge tournament against eight world champions the Bridge AI Nook was declared victorious. This is a world première the game of bridge still being a great challenge to Artificial Intelligence.
NooK is a new generation AI according to several aspects. The first one is related to the fact that Nook is hybrid since it is made up of symbolic rule-based modules and neural network one. Rather than learning by playing a huge amount of games, it begins by recovering and modeling human expertise in a Background Knowledge described using a relational logic. Moreover Nook is able to provide explanations related to each decision.  
The robot is  developed by NukkAI, a French start-up that we will present at the start of the talk. 
In the following we will give the basics of the game of bridge and its distinguishing characteristics from other mind games 
The other two parts will be devoted to the challenge and the description of the NooK modules.
