# Bridging the Gap Between AI Planning and Reinforcement Learning (PRL @ IJCAI) – [Workshop at IJCAI 2022 (July 23-29)](https://ijcai-22.org)

### This site presents the most up-to-date information about the PRL @ IJCAI workshop. Please, visit [IJCAI 2022](https://ijcai-22.org) for information about the general conference.

While  AI  Planning and  Reinforcement  Learning  communities focus  on  similar
sequential decision-making  problems, these communities remain  somewhat unaware
of each other  on specific problems, techniques,  methodologies, and evaluation.

This  workshop  aims  to  encourage discussion  and  collaboration  between  the
researchers in the  fields of AI planning and reinforcement  learning. We aim to
bridge  the  gap between  the  two  communities,  facilitate the  discussion  of
differences and similarities in existing techniques, and encourage collaboration
across the  fields. We  solicit interest  from AI researchers  that work  in the
intersection of planning  and reinforcement learning, in  particular, those that
focus on intelligent decision making. As  such, the joint workshop program is an
excellent  opportunity  to  gather  a  large and  diverse  group  of  interested
researchers.

## Workshop topics

The  workshop solicits work at the intersection of  the fields of  reinforcement
learning  and  planning.  One example  is so-called  goal-directed reinforcement
learning,  where a  goal must be  achieved,  and no partial credit  is given for
getting  closer to the goal.  In this case,  a usual metric is  success rate. We
also solicit work solely in one area that can influence advances in the other so
long as the connections are *clearly articulated* in the submission.

Submissions are invited for topics on, but not limited to:

* Theoretical aspects of planning and reinforcement learning
* Goal-oriented sequential decision methods combining planning, RL
  or other ML methods.
* Goal-directed reinforcement learning (model-based, Bayesian, deep, etc.)
* Safe Reinforcement Learning and Planning
* Certification/analysis of learned policies/models
* Neuro-symbolic methods for RL
* Hierarchical RL and symbolic abstractions
* Compositional RL and symbolic methods
* Planning using approximated/uncertain (learned) models
* Monte Carlo Planning
* Applications of planning methods to RL
* Various levels of generalization (across goals, objects/domain, domains)
* Reinforcement Learning and planning competition(s)/benchmarks

# Important Dates

* Camera-ready deadline: Friday, June 17th, 2022
* Workshop date: Vienna, July 23-25 (TBD), 2022

IJCAI will be **in-person** this year. Authors of accepted workshop papers are expected to physically attend the conference and present in person.

# Program - TBD

* Invited Speakers
* Schedule

# Submission Procedure

We  solicit  workshop paper  submissions  relevant  to  the  above call  of  the
following types:

* Long papers -- up to 8 pages + unlimited references / appendices
* Short papers -- up to 4 pages + unlimited references / appendices
* Extended abstracts -- up to 2 pages + unlimited references / appendices

Please format submissions  in AAAI style (see instructions in [Author Kit 2021 at AAAI, http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit22.zip](http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit22.zip)). Authors considering
submitting to the workshop papers rejected from other conferences, please ensure
you  do  your  utmost to  address  the  comments given  by the reviewers.

**New**: NeurIPS format is also accepted with the same number of pages and references as the call-for-papers for the main-track. 

Some accepted long  papers will be accepted as contributed  talks.  All accepted
long and short papers and extended abstracts  will be given a slot in the poster
presentation session.   Extended abstracts  are intended  as brief  summaries of
already published papers,  preliminary work, position papers  or challenges that
might help bridge the gap.

As the main purpose  of this workshop is to solicit  discussion, the authors are
invited to use the appendix of their submissions for that purpose.

[Paper submissions should be made through EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=prl20220).

Please send your inquiries by email to the organizers at [prl.theworkshop@gmail.com](mailto:prl.theworkshop@gmail.com).
